 # What can be done more

- Add more tests. Some unit tests are missing.
- Error handling can be improved. Custom error classes as part of the Domain.
- Status codes are not descriptive enought.As well as the error messages from the server.
- Authorization credentials are hardcoded.
- The application do not check if there is another entry of employee in the database with the same name. Data duplicated.
